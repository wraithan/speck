Speck
=====

Speck is a application I wrote because I disliked interupting my
workflow and thought processes to enter in what I am doing throughout
the day at work. It is commandline interface to letsfreckle.com. It is
in very early stages and probably isn't suitable to use outside of the
company I work for.
